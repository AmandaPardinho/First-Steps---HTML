			<p>Note 1: HTML serves to structure the site (it is the skeleton of the site). The appearance of the site is implemented by CSS.</p>
			<p>Note 2: When sections are not well defined, a space is opened up for the browser to interpret them as it wishes. This can lead to problems in structuring the site.</p>
			<p>Note 3: The syntactically correct way to use break is "br /" (it is a self-closing tag).</p>
			<p>Note 4: Today, visual changes are no longer made by HTML code. All visual changes are made in CSS.</p>
