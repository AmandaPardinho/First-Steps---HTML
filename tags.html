		<ul>
			<li>body: place where all content is inserted.</li>
			<li>main:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>the main content of a page;</li>
				<li>it is unique and exclusive to that page.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>br: line break.</li>
			<li>header: works both in the body and in the sections.</li>
			<li>footer:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>place to put HTML entities;</li>
				<li>works both in the body and in the sections.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>section:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>any part of a document</li>
				<li>each section has its own content;</li>
				<li>these contents can be separated as needed.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>article:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>kind of section that makes sense on its own;</li>
				<li>is self-contained.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>nav:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>navigation menu;</li>
				<li>can create an internal navigation menu (within the site itself) or an external one (to another
					site).</li>
			</ul>
			<li>aside:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>shows that a certain content is not substantial for what is delivered on that page;</li>
				<li>is complementary information;</li>
				<li>can be used to place advertisements on a website.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>div:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>non-semantic tag;</li>
				<ul>
					<li>should be used as little as possible in relation to the other tags.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>should be used when you want to make a subdivision in the semantic content, but there is no specific
					tag for this;</li>
				<li>is a content block;</li>
				<ul>
					<li>it occupies the space of this block from beginning to end (from one edge to the other);</li>
				</ul>
				<li>divides the text into blocks;</li>
				<li>all semantic content is a div;</li>
				<ul>
					<li>they are div that have been given a name and a specific function.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<li>span:separates a piece of text when you want to keep it in the same block.</li>
			<li>headline:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>-describe what the section does;</li>
				<li>-can be used in any area of the site, being particularly important in articles and sections;</li>
				<li>-goes from h1 to h6.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>paragraph: assists in defining the normal text flow.</li>
			<li>links:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>-are the reference from one page to another page;</li>
				<li>-are defined as anchor links;</li>
				<ul>
					<li>-anchor: the point to which you are linking and that can be a letter, a word, or an image;</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<li>you use the "href" inside the link tag to reference the path that must be followed;</li>
			<ul>
				<li>ways to type the link path:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>with nothing: related to the current location;</li>
					<li>../: one level higher;</li>
					<li>/: current root;</li>
					<li>protocol + url;</li>
					<li>https://;</li>
					<li>//url;</li>
				</ul>
				<li>target: says the location where you want to open the link;</li>
				<ul>
					<li>optional component;</li>
					<li>good practice: do not "break" the back button, i.e. do not open the page in a new tab (Did I do
						that? Of course not. >] );</li>
					<li>_self: opens in the same tab;</li>
					<li>_blank: opens in another tab;</li>
					<li>_parent: used when you are in an iframe inside another page (popup?).</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<li>list:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>various contents can be classified as lists;</li>
				<li>content classified as lists makes it easier for the reader to understand what is being written at a
					certain point in the text;</li>
				<li>also make it easier for machines to understand what kind of content that is, even without having
					direct access to the meaning of the content;</li>
				<li>there are two types of lists:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>ordered: the order of the elements matters;</li>
					<li>unordered: the order of the elements does not matter;</li>
				</ul>
				<li>the lists can be made separately or one inside the other</li>
			</ul>

			<li>Note 1: HTML serves to structure the site (it is the skeleton of the site). The appearance of the site
				is implemented by CSS.</li>
			<li>Note 2: When sections are not well defined, a space is opened up for the browser to interpret them as it
				wishes. This can lead to problems in structuring the site.</li>
			<li>Note 3: The syntactically correct way to use break is "br /" (it is a self-closing tag).</li>
			<li>Note 4: Today, visual changes are no longer made by HTML code. All visual changes are made in CSS.</li>
